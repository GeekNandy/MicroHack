## MicroHack introduction

### What is Business Continuity?

When you design for resiliency, you must understand your availability requirements.
- How much downtime is acceptable? 
- How much will potential downtime cost your business?
- How much should you invest in making the application highly available?
- You also must define what it means for the application to be available.

ðŸ’¡ For instance, would you consider the application to be â€˜unavailableâ€™ if it allows you to place an order, but fails to process it within the usual time period? Also, itâ€™s crucial to evaluate the likelihood of a system failure. Is implementing a countermeasure strategy financially justifiable? Remember, effective resilience planning is rooted in the businessâ€™s needs. Here are some strategies to guide your thinking when planning for system resiliency.

The following picture describes in details the individual levels / disaster recovery tier levels and also provides an overview of which topics we should deal with when talking about disaster recovery. The individual terms, terminologies and categories will be discussed in this microhack which will also provide one approach and a few tips on how to define them in your own company.

## MicroHack Challenges

### General prerequisites

This MicroHack has a few but important prerequisites to be understood before starting this lab!

* Your own Azure subscription with Owner RBAC rights at the subscription level
  * [Azure Evaluation free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/search/?OCID=AIDcmmzzaokddl_SEM_0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e:G:s&ef_id=0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e:G:s&msclkid=0fa7acb99db91c1fb85fcfd489e5ca6e)

## Challenge 0 - Understand the Disaster Recovery (DR) terms and define a DR strategy

If you have already worked at a senior level or have been working in IT for many years, you may be able to skip this intro challenge.

The DR terms and strategy should be defined in every organization, and most importantly, is that the Business Continuity Management and all the necessary steps for disaster recovery are regularly tested.

### Goal

The goal from this challenge is to help you comprehend the complexities of business continuity management and familiarize yourself with its key terms. In second place, it is to support you to define a strategy and to put yourself into different roles to view the requirements from different perspectives.

1. What exactly is the difference between Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity?
2. Who is responsible for BCDR?
3. Is there a difference between High Availability & Disaster Recovery?
4. Do I really need Backup & Disaster Recovery?

### Actions

* Write down the first 3 steps you would go for if your company got attacked by ransomware.
* Think about if you ever participated in a business continuity test scenario.
* Put yourself in the position of an application owner and define the necessary steps to make sure your application stays available in case of a disaster.
* Identify who defines the requirements for Business Continuity and what are the necessary KPIÂ´s for an application to reach a good SLA in terms of availability.
* Define and write down four different categories of Disaster Recovery Tier Levels that applications can use incl. the availability SLA.
* Plan the different geographic regions you need to use for reaching the highest availability SLA (you can also include your datacenter locations).

### Success criteria

* Understood the different terms from BCDR.
* Identified the initial three steps to take following a ransomware attack in your company.
* Thought about the last successful disaster recovery of daily used applications.
* Identified the responsibilities and roles within your current company in respect to BCDR.
* Defined four levels of disaster recovery categories, including availability SLA.

## Challenge 4 - Protect your Azure PaaS (Azure SQL Database and Storage Account) with Disaster recovery

### Goal

In challenge 4, you will focus on implementing disaster recovery strategies for Azure SQL databases using Failover Groups, and for Azure storage accounts using replication. The primary objective is to ensure business continuity by protecting critical data stored in Azure SQL databases and Azure storage accounts against potential disasters.

### Actions
* Implement Failover Groups for Azure SQL Database:
  * Create a Failover Group between two Azure SQL databases located in different Azure regions (North Europe and Sweden Central).
  * Configure automatic failover policies and test the failover mechanism to ensure seamless transition in case of a disaster.
* Disaster Recovery for Azure Storage Account:
  * Set up and configure Azure Storage Account replication to another region using Geo-redundant storage (GRS) or Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS) to ensure data availability in case of regional outages.
  * Perform a failover test for the storage account to validate the disaster recovery setup.

### âœ… Success Criteria

* You have successfully created and configured a Failover Group for Azure SQL Database, ensuring data is replicated and accessible across regions.
* You have implemented disaster recovery for an Azure Storage Account using GRS or GZRS, protecting against regional outages.
* You have conducted failover tests for both the Azure SQL Database and Azure Storage Account, demonstrating the effectiveness of your disaster recovery strategy.
* You were able to connect to the failed-over SQL DB and the failed-over Storage Account from the failed-over VM.
