### 4. Simulate Failures/Load Testing with Azure Chaos Studio
Use Azure Chaos Studio to simulate failures and perform load testing on your N-tier application.


Can you help me create a chaos experiment in Azure Chaos Studio?

```bash
# Example command to create a chaos experiment
az chaos experiment create --name myChaosExperiment --resource-group myResourceGroup
```

To create a chaos experiment in Azure Chaos Studio, follow these steps:

Open the Azure portal and search for Chaos Studio.
Select the Experiments tab and click on Create > New experiment.
Fill in the Subscription, Resource Group, and Location where you want to deploy the chaos experiment. Give your experiment a name and select Next: Experiment designer.
In the Chaos Studio experiment designer, add steps and branches. Give friendly names to your Step and Branch, and select Add action > Add fault.
Choose the type of fault you want to apply (e.g., CPU Pressure or VM Shutdown) and fill in the required parameters such as Duration and pressureLevel.
Select your target resources and verify that your experiment looks correct.
Finally, select Review + create > Create to initiate the experiment.
