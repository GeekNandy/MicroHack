## Use Azure Copilot to calculate the composite SLAs for your application.

### Example Prompts

```
What are the SLAs for my Azure resources?
```

```
Can you show me the SLAs for Azure App Service?

<br>

1. Identify the Azure services (components) that are connected.
2. Determine the chains of components within the application.
3. Use the latest SLA provided by Microsoft in [Service Level Agreements (SLA) for Online Services](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Service-Level-Agreements-SLA-for-Online-Services?lang=1&year=2024) to find the SLA for each component in the chain.
4. Multiply the SLA values of each individual component (link) in the chain to get the composite SLA for that chain.
5. Identify the weakest link â€“ the component/composites with the lowest SLA.
